# Deployment configuration
# Copy to deployment.config and fill in your values.
# deployment.config is gitignored - never commit real IPs or secrets.

# EC2 IP addresses
# EC2_ELASTIC_IP is preferred (static, survives restarts)
# EC2_IP is the dynamic Public IPv4 (changes on restart)
EC2_IP=54.123.45.67
EC2_ELASTIC_IP=

# Domain (optional - for nginx and CORS config)
DOMAIN=yourdomain.com

# GitHub repo URL - if set, deploy uses "git pull" instead of copying files (faster)
# Example: https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
GITHUB_URL=

# Branch to pull (default: main)
GITHUB_BRANCH=main

# SSH key (path relative to project root)
